## Code Description

This code adds database functionality to a slambook app where one can add and save friends to their slambook. Updated to have delete and edit functionality as well.

## Things you did in the code

I made use of providers, models and api folders to create functions for adding, editing and deleting the slambook entries as well as getting the data from the cloud firestore. There were also some minor changes to the previous files where I needed to tweak what was being passed to the pages as I know used a provider. 

## Challenges encountered

A challenge I encountered was the database not loading and so it just keeps on loading without displaying the friend list. I found out that I can just hot reload to combat this, however I have not been able to find fixes yet.
