## Code Description

The code is a digital slambook that makes use of various form fields to get input from the user with functionality of saving the different people that inputted in the slambook.
## Things you did in the code

I made use of different widgets like the textformfield, dropdownbutton, switch and others to make a digital slambook. This is done through combination of said widgets as well as buttons for saving and resetting the form fields. Aside from this, I made use of navigation widgets like drawer and routes to link the different parts of the app together.
## Challenges encountered

It was difficult tracing how the different parts should go together.
